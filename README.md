# Vapulus Contact List

This is a sample application where [simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js) and [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) are used for validation and data persistance respectively.

### Start the Project

```
npm install
npm run start
```

I've went ahead and included the Postman collection used for development and testing so you can perform these requests easily.
